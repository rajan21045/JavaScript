# 📚 JavaScript Learning Journey

Welcome to my **JavaScript Learning Repository**! 🚀  

This is my personal space for learning, practicing, and documenting everything I discover about JavaScript — from the absolute basics to advanced concepts.
  
Here, you'll find organized notes, example scripts, exercises, and small projects that I create while improving my skills.  

The goal is to track my progress, stay consistent, and build a solid foundation for real-world web development.
